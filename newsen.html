      <b>Memorandum of Cooperation Signed Between the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Central Bank of the Kingdom of Bahrain</b>
    </p>
    <p>
     On June 1, 2025, an official meeting took place in Manama (Kingdom of Bahrain) between the Chairman of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic Melis Turgunbaev and the Chairman of the Central Bank of the Kingdom of Bahrain Khalid Ibrahim Humaidan.
    </p>
    <p>
     The visit of the Chairman of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic followed up on agreements reached during the recent state visit of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic to the Kingdom of Bahrain. During the presidential visit, the parties reaffirmed their mutual interest in strengthening bilateral partnership, including developing cooperation in the financial and economic spheres. The signing of the interbank memorandum was the first practical step toward implementing the high-level agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the meeting, the parties discussed a wide range of issues related to deepening cooperation between the central banks, as well as between the financial institutions of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Kingdom of Bahrain. Special attention was paid to the exchange of experience in banking regulation, the development of financial markets, and prospects for promoting Islamic finance.
    </p>
    <p>
     The key outcome of the meeting was the signing of the Memorandum of Cooperation between the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Central Bank of the Kingdom of Bahrain, which lays a solid institutional foundation for strategic partnership and long-term interaction between the two countries.
    </p>
    <p>
     The signing of the Memorandum is a significant event, marking a new chapter in Kyrgyz-Bahraini relations. The document affirms the parties’ intention to expand cooperation in key areas of central bank activities, including joint research, professional development, information exchange in monetary policy, as well as the promotion and implementation of Islamic banking principles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Considering the growing role of Islamic finance in the global economy, cooperation with the Kingdom of Bahrain — one of the recognized international centers of Islamic finance — presents a unique opportunity for the Kyrgyz Republic to adopt best practices in this field and enhance investment inflows in accordance with Sharia principles.
    </p>
    <p>
     The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic views the signing of the Memorandum not only as a step toward strengthening interbank cooperation, but also as a contribution to the development of economic and financial dialogue between the Kyrgyz Republic and the Kingdom of Bahrain in general.

      <b>The National Bank warns about fraud risks</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In connection with the increased cases of fraud involving new technologies, including the use of photos of National Bank officials obtained from open sources in messengers, phone number spoofing, voice distortion, etc., we inform the following.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The National Bank does not call or send official IDs to citizens via messengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The National Bank does not offer assistance in returning funds, does not provide services related to criminal cases, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The National Bank does not open accounts for citizens, does not serve individuals, and does not conduct monetary settlements with the population.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fraudsters under various pretexts (loan registration, risk of criminal prosecution, commission withdrawal for money transfers from abroad, help with refunds, etc.) pursue the sole goal — to seize others' money.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, methods of deceiving the population are regularly updated, so it is necessary to constantly remain vigilant and extremely cautious to avoid becoming a victim of fraudsters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The National Bank urges you not to follow suspicious web links under any circumstances, not to transfer money to strangers under any pretext, and to verify information through official contact details of the organization whose employee the unknown person claims to be.

      <b>INFORMATION MESSAGE<br>From the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic, in honor of the significant anniversary — the 80th Victory in the Great Patriotic War, from April 28, 2025, introduces into circulation a silver collectible coin "80 Years of the Great Victory" from the "Historical Events" series.
    </p>
    <p>
      For decades, Victory Day — May 9 — remains a day of unity, remembrance of the fallen, and gratitude for the heroism and dedication of war veterans and home front workers. For courage and bravery shown in the Great Patriotic War, more than 150 thousand Kyrgyzstanis were awarded orders and medals. The title Hero of the Soviet Union was awarded to 74 people, 34 people were recipients of the Orders of Glory of three degrees, and more than 8 thousand Kyrgyzstanis were awarded honorary certificates of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Kyrgyzstan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The irreplaceable debt to the memory of those who died and those who survived the war must never be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main design on the obverse of the "80 Years of the Great Victory" coin is a stylized number "80" in the form of a festive salute. At the top of the coin, there is a star, and at the bottom, an image of a bouquet of red carnations framed by a ribbon symbolizing mourning and respect for those who died in the war. Around the coin is the inscription: "Улуу Жеңишке – 80 жыл / 80 лет Великой Победе".
    </p>
    <p>
      On the reverse side, the center features the emblem of the Kyrgyz Republic, framed by the numbers "2025" and "1945" against a background of flying doves symbolizing peace and freedom. Around the coin is the inscription "Кыргыз Республикасынын Улуттук банкы / National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic". At the bottom of the coin are the metal purity mark (Ag 925), the year of issue "2025", and the coin's weight (28.28 g).
